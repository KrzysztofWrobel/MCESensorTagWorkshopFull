BLE SensorTag
==============

**This is not an official application for TI SensorTag.** It is a sample project for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) usage on Android. There was [TI SensorTag][1] module used for demonstration.

There were SensorTag UUIDs linked in application to get information from BLE device sensors.

Please read official [SensorTag User Guide][2] for more information about SensorTag development.

## Troubleshooting
If you have problems with TI Sensor Tag services detection or any sensor doesn't work you should try to update [firmware of SensorTag](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/SensorTag_Firmware)

Also you can take a look on [TI open source project for SensorTag](http://git.ti.com/sensortag-android).
